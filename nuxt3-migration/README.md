# MapPrint Nuxt 3 Migration

This directory contains the migration of the MapPrint project from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3. The migration preserves all the original content and functionality while upgrading the framework.

## Setup

Before running the project, execute the setup script to prepare the environment:

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup script to copy all content from the original project
./setup.sh
```

The setup script does the following:
1. Creates all necessary directories
2. Copies config files from the original project
3. Copies static assets to the public directory
4. Copies other assets (SCSS, images, fonts)
5. Copies locale files for all supported languages
6. Creates fallback files when originals are not found
7. Disables TypeScript checking during development

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: TypeScript checking is currently disabled to facilitate the migration process. Once the migration is complete, it will be re-enabled.

## Content Preservation

This migration maintains all the original content:
- Map configurations from `assets/config/*.json`
- Static files from `static/*` (moved to `public/*`)
- Locale files from `locales/*.json`
- SCSS styles from `assets/sass/*`
- Images from `assets/images/*`

## Structure

The project follows the Nuxt 3 directory structure:

- `app.vue`: Main application component
- `components/`: Vue components
- `pages/`: Application pages
- `public/`: Static files (replaces `static/` from Nuxt 2)
- `assets/`: Application assets (styles, images, etc.)
- `layouts/`: Application layouts
- `middleware/`: Nuxt middleware
- `plugins/`: Nuxt plugins
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `@types/`: Additional type definitions

## Migration Status

- [x] Project structure set up
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Basic components migrated
- [x] Dependencies updated
- [x] i18n configuration updated
- [ ] Complete asset migration
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Enable TypeScript checking

## Known Issues

1. Image assets need to be properly migrated
   - Copy images from `static/images` to `public/images` with: `cp -r ../static/images/* public/images/`
   - This is needed because Nuxt 3 uses `public` instead of `static` for static assets
2. TypeScript checking is disabled until all type issues are resolved
3. Some components may still need migration work
4. The paths in component templates need to be updated from `~/assets/...` to `/...` for public assets

## Troubleshooting

If you see the error page with "存在しないページ、またはエラーが発生したページです":

1. Make sure the public directory contains necessary images:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/images
   cp -r ../static/images/* public/images/
   ```

2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Try disabling TypeScript checking completely with:
   ```bash
   export NUXT_TYPESCRIPT_CHECK=false
   npm run dev
   ```

## Debugging with VSCode

The project is configured for debugging with VSCode:

1. Install the recommended extensions (Vue Language Features, ESLint, Prettier)
2. Open the Debug panel in VSCode
3. Select "fullstack: nuxt" from the dropdown
4. Press F5 or click the green play button

This will:
- Start the Nuxt dev server in debug mode
- Launch Chrome with debugger attached
- Allow you to set breakpoints in both server and client code
- Enable source maps for accurate debugging

You can also debug server-side only by selecting "server: nuxt" or client-side only with "client: chrome".

Debugging features:
- Set breakpoints in .vue files
- Inspect variables and call stack
- Use the debug console to evaluate expressions
- Hot reloading still works while debugging
